== About ==

Bit arrays are arrays of bits (values zero or one).  This is a convenient and
efficient implementation for C/C++.  

Bit arrays are initialised to zero when created or extended.  All operations
have their bounds checked - an "Out of bounds" error is printed if you try to
access a bit with index >= length.

Please get in touch if you have suggestions / requests / bugs.  

== Build ==

To build and run the test code:

$ make
$ ./bit_array_test

== Methods ==

Add to the top of your code:

#include "bit_array.h"

You can then call the following methods:

// Constructor - create a new bit array of length nbits
BIT_ARRAY* bit_array_create(bit_index_t nbits);

// Destructor - free the memory used for a bit array
void bit_array_free(BIT_ARRAY* bitarray);

// set a bit (to 1) at position b
void bit_array_set_bit(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t b);

// clear a bit (to 0) at position b
void bit_array_clear_bit(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t b);

// Get the value of a bit (returns 0 or 1)
char bit_array_get_bit(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t b);

// Set all bits in this array to 0
void bit_array_fill_zeros(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr);

// Set all bits in this array to 1
void bit_array_fill_ones(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr);

// Clear all the bits in a region
void bit_array_clear_region(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr,
                            bit_index_t start, bit_index_t length);

// Set all the bits in a region
void bit_array_set_region(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr,
                          bit_index_t start, bit_index_t length);

// Get length of bit array
bit_index_t bit_array_length(BIT_ARRAY* bit_arr);

// Get this array as a string (remember to free the result!)
char* bit_array_to_string(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr);

// Copy a BIT_ARRAY struct and the data it holds - returns pointer to new object
BIT_ARRAY* bit_array_clone(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr);

// Copy bits from one array to another
// Destination and source can be the same bit_array and
// src/dst regions can overlap
void bit_array_copy(BIT_ARRAY* dst, bit_index_t dstindx,
                    BIT_ARRAY* src, bit_index_t srcindx,
                    bit_index_t length);

// Enlarge or shrink the size of a bit array
// Shrinking will free some memory if it is large
// Enlarging an array will add zeros to the end of it
// returns 1 on success, 0 on failure
char bit_array_resize(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t new_num_of_bits);

//
// Logic operators
//   destination and source bit arrays must be of the same length,
//   however, they may point to the same object
//
void bit_array_and(BIT_ARRAY* dest, BIT_ARRAY* src1, BIT_ARRAY* src2);
void bit_array_or(BIT_ARRAY* dest, BIT_ARRAY* src1, BIT_ARRAY* src2);
void bit_array_xor(BIT_ARRAY* dest, BIT_ARRAY* src1, BIT_ARRAY* src2);
void bit_array_not(BIT_ARRAY* dest, BIT_ARRAY* src);

// Compare two bit arrays by value stored
// arrays do not have to be the same length (e.g. 101 (5) > 00000011 (3))
int bit_array_compare(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr1, BIT_ARRAY* bitarr2);

// start index must be within the range of the bit array (0 <= x < length)
uint64_t bit_array_word64(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t start);
uint32_t bit_array_word32(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t start);
uint16_t bit_array_word16(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t start);
uint8_t  bit_array_word8 (BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, bit_index_t start);

//
// Read/Write bit_array to a file
//
// File format is [8 bytes: for number of elements in array][data]
// Number of bytes of data is: (int)((num_of_bits + 7) / 8)
//

// Saves bit array to a file
// returns the number of bytes written
bit_index_t bit_array_save(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr, FILE* f);

// Reads bit array from a file
// returns bit array or NULL on failure
BIT_ARRAY* bit_array_load(FILE* f);

//
// Experimental
//

// Return 0 if there was an overflow error
char bit_array_add(BIT_ARRAY* dest, BIT_ARRAY* src1, BIT_ARRAY* src2);

// If there is an overflow, bit array will be set to all 1s and 0 is returned
// Returns 0 if there was an overflow, 1 otherwise
char bit_array_increment(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr);

// If there is an underflow, bit array will be set to all 0s and 0 is returned
// Returns 0 if there was an underflow, 1 otherwise
char bit_array_decrement(BIT_ARRAY* bitarr);

== Development ==

To do:
* shift left / right (filled in with passed value 0 or 1)
* cycle left / right

Need re-writing:
* bit_array_add
* bit_array_increment
* bit_array_decrement

Also:
* write test cases for each method (test cases to go in bit_array_test.c)
